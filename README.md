# Evolutionary-Computation
Evolutionary Algorithm For Classification of Heart Diseases in Python


This project was made in the scope of the course Evolutionary Computation in the University of Coimbra. The objective of this work was to test different mutation and crossing over methods in order to initialize the weights of a simple neural network model. The final goal was to create a model who could predict if the heart was unhealthy. 

This project counted on the contribution of Nelson Monteiro (Git Id NelsonRCMonteiro) and Diogo Pessoa (Git Id DiogoMPessoa).
